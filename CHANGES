Changelog
=========

0.2.0 (unreleased)
------------------

- Significant api changes moving towards a proper stable release
- Considerably more documentation in the form of rst-enhanced docstrings.
- Repository class now has significantly fewer methods
- Versions is now simply a series of helper classmethods applied to a subclass
  of ``set``.
- Gone from zero unit test-coverage to almost full unit test-coverage.
- Uploader is still used, but can upload as many distributions as necessary via
  the repository class meaning the upload/register api is now simply::

    r = Repository('http://url.com')
    d = Distribution('/path/to/package-1.2.3.tgz')
    r.register(d)
    r.upload(d)

  where the uploader used can be swapped out if necessary by passing a
  different Uploader class to the Repository when it is instantiated.
- Added a using the library section to the documentation

0.1.0 (2013-03-02)
